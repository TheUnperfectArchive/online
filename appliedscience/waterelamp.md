# 🌟 Activate a Lamp with Water 

### *A Fun Learning: Building under*

Welcome to this exciting STEM DIY activity!
Here you will make a **magic diya** that lights up when you pour water into it.

Perfect for learning **electronics**, **science**, and **creativity**.

---

## ✨ What Are We Making?

A special diya that glows **only when water is added**!

We use a transistor, LED, wires, a coin battery, and a plastic cup (like an ice-cream cup).

Tap water (little conductive) acts as a **secret switch** that turns ON the LED.

---

## 📦 Materials Needed

* Plastic cup (ice-cream cup or any small plastic container)
* 1 × LED (any colour)
* 1 × Transistor (BC547 or any NPN transistor)
* 1 × Coin cell battery (3V)
* 2 × Wires
* Tap Water
* Tape or glue (optional for fixing components)

## 🧠 Science Behind the Magic

### 💧 Why Tapwater not Saltwater since salt is better conductor?

Straight answer is that tap water is easily available without a pre paration need like making salt water.
The circuit we gonna make doestn't required much conductive just a little bit to trigger transistor through which Led main circuit works.
Pure water doesn’t conduct electricity well.
Where **saltwater conducts** because salt breaks into tiny charged particles. These particles allow electricity to flow.
Tap water is inbetween, not pure and not conductive as salt water but good for our purpose since thats what magic is about (make happen least expected event).

### ⚡ What Does the Transistor Do?

A transistor works like a **smart switch**.

* When a *tiny current* (through water) touches the transistor’s **base**,
  it *opens the switch*.
* Then the **battery** can power the **LED**.

So the diya lights up *only when water is poured in*.

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **1. Prepare the Cup**

* Take a food delivery package waste like small sauce package (best option) and clean it.

### **2. Insert Wires**

* Strip the ends of two wires (remove insulation).
* Insert the bare ends inside the two holes.

These will touch the saltwater later.

### **3. Connect the Transistor**

* Connect **one wire** to the **base** of the transistor.

Where:

* C = Collector
* B = Base
* E = Emitter

### **4. Connect the LED**

* Connect the **positive leg (longer leg)** of the LED to the **positive terminal** of the coin cell.
* Connect the **negative leg** of the LED to the **collector** of the transistor.

### **5. Connect Battery Negative**

* Connect the **negative terminal** of the battery to the **emitter** of the transistor.

### **6. Add Saltwater**

* Put **1 spoon of salt** in the cup.
* Pour water inside.

As soon as water touches the two wire ends →
**small current → transistor ON → LED glows!**

## 🎯 What Kids Learn

* Basics of **LEDs**, **transistors**, and simple circuits
* Conductive liquids and how electricity flows
* How switches work
* Creativity + hands-on building
* Observation and troubleshooting skills

---

## ⚠ Safety Tips

* Use only a **3V coin cell** (safe for kids).
* Never use bigger batteries like 9V or power banks.
* Do not let water touch the battery directly.
* Dry hands before handling wires or battery.
* Dispose things properly after the activity.

## 🌟 Fun Experiments to Try

* Try **different LED colours**.
* Decorate the cup to look like a festival diya.
* Try *adding salt* — notice brightness changes.
* Try using two LEDs in parallel.
* Try making two diyas that glow together!

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

| Problem         | Possible Reason          | Fix                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| LED not glowing | Lose connection          | Check solder and continuity|
| LED still off   | Wires not touching water | Insert further        |
| Very dim light  | Weak battery             | Replace coin cell     |
| No light        | Wrong transistor pins    | Check C-B-E positions |

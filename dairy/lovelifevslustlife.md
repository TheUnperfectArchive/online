# 🫂 Lovelife vs ❤‍🔥 Lustlife

Before moving ahead, let me try to express clearly what I am sharing and clarify the context.

## 🌱 Lovelife

By Lovelife, I do not mean romance alone.

It is a way of living where life is not something you only take from, but something you intend to give to as well.

Life offers us experiences, lessons, joy, and even difficulties.
In return, we offer our kindness, our effort, and our honesty.
Giving our best makes this world a little better than the one we experienced.

Everything we go through is shaped by the actions of people before us and around us.
It is not difficult to see how actions flow and spread on a larger scale.

Lovelife is a two-way relationship with the world.

You do not just live in the world.
You live with the world.

## 🔥 Lustlife

Lustlife is not only about physical desire.

It is a one-sided way of living.
It is a mindset where a person keeps demanding from life, family, and society, while ignoring the responsibility to care or give back.

This person expects the world to fulfill endless desires.
This is a life full of expectations without a sense of responsibility.

Since no life is only a giver or only a taker, this idea is not about calling any person “lustlife”.
It is only about a mindset.

## 🤔 Why I Am Thinking About This

In my conscious mind, I understand that we cannot control how our actions will finally manifest.
But we can stay connected with our intentions and our authenticity.

We believe in our intentions and express our best.
The rest remains a mystery.

So being in Lovelife or Lustlife is not a task to achieve.
It is not a scale to judge anyone, including ourselves.

Lust is not fully negative.
It is a basic or early form of love.
It is an immature way of relating to life and relationships.

It may be messy, but it is part of the journey.
Almost everything begins from there.

I am a growing life, not a ready-made wise one.

I have carried many lusts.
Now with maturity, I see them slowly turning into love.

Every person has a shadow and a consciousness.
I also have both.

I am not perfect in this life.
But that does not mean I cannot improve or change myself.

Everything can be perfect and still be improved.

## 🏝 A Story to Picture This

Imagine you are left alone on an island in the middle of the ocean, far from help and support.
There you find a heavenly fruit tree.

🌳 This tree has special rules:

- It can bear fruit forever.

- Fruits on the tree never rot.

- When the number of fruits reaches its maximum, the tree drops its best mature fruit to the ground so that a new fruit can grow.


**But:**

- Once a fruit touches the ground, it begins its mortal cycle and will rot if not eaten.

- The growth of new fruits becomes slower depending on how many fruits you pluck.


If you take one fruit a day, a new fruit appears the next day.
The number of fruits stays the same.

If you take two or more fruits, the growth of new fruits is delayed by that many days.

You already have one fallen fruit plus one fruit to pluck.
This is more than enough to survive.

But the fruits are divinely tasty and they tempt you to take more.
If you stretch your stomach, your hunger grows.

At first, you do not know the natural rules.
You pluck without thinking, you eat too much, and you waste fruits.
The tree becomes weak.
Branches break.
Fruits rot on the ground.

One day you see that the tree is no longer rich.
You feel death coming, both for the tree and for yourself.

It feels like the tree is saying:

> “By exploiting me, you are destroying yourself too. Please let us both live.”

After this, you begin to care.
You create your own ideas and practices to sustain both your life and the tree.

This slows your damage and improves your actions.
But it does not solve everything.

You still need to understand the tree and understand yourself.

The journey of truth must begin.
There is no manual for existence.

The concepts you create through imagination and experiment are the only stick in the hand of the blind, like you, to understand.

and Growth does not follow a straight line.

Sometimes everything goes well and sometimes you make mistakes again.

## ✨ The Lesson

- The self is more than “you, I, me, and they”.

- What begins as lust can grow into love when we give sincere effort.

- Focusing on Lovelife helps us heal.

## 🧭 My Frame of Seeing Life

I have not reached anywhere extraordinary.
I am only trying to find a better framework for seeing life.

My ideas of life open in many directions.
It becomes difficult to avoid philosophical complexity.

I have strong faith in life, in people, in nature, and in the soul or spirit.
At the same time, I try to observe and understand things around me,
because existence is beautiful and worth knowing.

🛐I am religious if religion means following good principles, ethics, and steadiness in action.
🔬I am scientific when being scientific means staying aware of every bit and byte of life and the world for good.

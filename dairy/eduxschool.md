# 🪶 Education ≠ School
### My Journey Beyond School Walls

Hey there!

You know what's funny? Everyone thinks education = school, but that's not how I see it. My story is different, and I bet yours is too.

I'm just gonna pour my heart out here about my learning journey. It's messy, it's real, and it started way before I even knew what a classroom was. And guess what? It's still going on!

School came in between my learning journey and is still unclear to me.

We will talk about that school part later 😄

First, let me share my real “education.” Not the one written on paper, but the one life has given me.

## 🌿 My Roots

Let me tell you about where I come from. It's kind of a mix, you know? My maa (that's what I call my mother) is from the countryside, and my father has always been a city person. This blend gave me something special — a view of both worlds.

In my childhood, I remember during school vacations we (me, maa and my brother) spent our time at my mother's countryside house.  
It was a mud house which maa used to say she made with her own hands. In many rural areas even now, people still build their houses by themselves using locally available materials.

Later, the frequency of travelling to the countryside slowed down and finally stopped. Life had to happen in the city.

But maa's soul is green. She kept planting trees and small plants around her even when many people opposed her.

She lived the typical middle-class housewife life, always serving her in-laws, which was tiring and overwhelming. My brother was very helpful to her and reduced some of her burden. I played the role of a critic standing behind the stage. I was not very useful because of my rebellious behaviour toward the system.

Even in the middle of all that push and pull, she taught me many things such as **painting, clay work, gardening and cooking**.  
and Because of her, I am good at **art**.

Pappa (my father) fully engaged himself in job life because the traditional business wasn’t enough.

My father’s side of the family has a long migration history, so there were always survival struggles. They did whatever had to be done, adapted to new cultures and practices.

Pappa is a responsible man and time has tested him well. Work consumed him, and it always looked overwhelming to me. He communicated very little with us. We know our maa much more than we know our father. Still, the support he gave from the background contributed greatly to our growth.

Through living and involvement, I learned many skills and understandings from my family.

Everyone played their role, and in the end made me what I was meant to become.

Yes, there are traumas, sadness, failures, friction, politics and unforgivable events.  
But in the present, I am positive about myself and my people. They may not fully understand me, but they have always loved me.

### My Root?

It does not mean family, community or country for me.  
I am talking about that part of me which is always in the depth of my existence.  
Maybe language cannot fully express it.

It is deep and confusing, so I will continue it someday somewhere else.

But I have seen a driving force inside me that has always been there, or maybe it is me itself.

Even with very similar experiences, I went on a different path.

Interest and curiosity toward science and philosophy were not part of my family or surroundings.

Maybe it was television or books — however it happened, it happened.

## 🌼 My Early Learning

As I shared, I learned many things within my family, but to understand the outer world I needed something outside the family environment.

This is where schools hold meaning for many people.

When I started school, I slowly became distant from my people. It had to happen because time, energy and focus shifted.

School could have become a wonderful system, but the people inside it are not ready for that.

At first, I studied in a Christian school, and those were the best moments of my school life. Till then, that was the only time I truly loved being in school.

At that time, I was experiencing the best learning and living moments — I had friends, teachers were nice and supportive, and the school felt open and inviting.

I was good at handwriting, drawing, clay work and all that, mainly because of maa.

## 🏫 When School Became a Cage

In fifth grade, I was suddenly sent to another school, and that change was very hard.

In the new place, everything went wrong.  
**Languages were forced, art was called useless,** and students cared more about mocking each other than making friends.

Because I looked a bit different — fair skin and brown hair — I stood out even more.

I started avoiding school.  
I went only enough to pass my exams.

## 🌈 Escaping into Imagination

After that, school never felt right to me.  
It killed my curiosity and creativity.  
It filled me with fear and shame.

Slowly, I started living in my own world of imagination.  
Me and my brother were fond of watching cartoons (which still continues).  
I used to draw pictures, create characters, and make my own stories. As I sharpened my ability, I developed a natural sense of visual thinking. I used to imagine sci-fi machines like the ones in comics and cartoon series.

That is how I became interested in science and technology.  
But I still did not appreciate school science. The science I loved was the one I saw in real life and the one my imagination was searching for.

I was a slow turtle 🐢  
I believed in understanding, not memorising.

But school was a race.  
There was no space for slow learners like me.

I realised that if I stayed trapped there, I would lose real knowledge and my love for science would die.

Not wrong to say that most schools are enemies of knowledge.

## 📚 A Self-Learner

The only way left was to self-teach myself, and for that I had to adapt to “learning while doing”.

That is how I became a **Self-Designed Learner**, someone who learns by himself.

For me, school became only a formality, not a place to learn.

I tried dropping school many times to try new experiments, but failed, so I had to continue.

I loved science, especially **lab work**.  
Later I studied chemistry in bachelor’s and master’s (finally dropped in between my master’s).

Everyone questioned me because I said I liked science and I actually did. But school science had no meaning for me because everything in it was about career or work, not about life, discovering the unknown, or creating something beautiful.

## 🌱 A Turning Point

I joined the **Barefoot Social Research Fellowship**, thanks to [**PUKAR**](https://pukar.org.in/) and **TISS, Mumbai**, during my college time.

There I met my first **Learning Facilitator**.  
Before that, I had only met teachers, and they were not very inspiring for continuing my learning.

This fellowship gave me new freedom.  
It introduced me to **interdisciplinary learning**, which later helped me find purpose in my knowledge.

After finishing it and staying in touch with the group, I told my facilitator, “I want to stop this academia thing and learn things in my own way.”

My facilitator told me about [**Swaraj University (Udaipur)**](https://www.swarajuniversity.org/), an experimental learning space for self-driven learners.  
That is where my life and learning took a turning point.

After that, I connected with many groups.  
The most influential ones were [**Vigyan Ashram**](https://vigyanashram.com/) and later [**The Fab Foundation**](https://fabfoundation.org/), where I completed [**Fab Academy**](https://fabacademy.org/).

## 🦋 Becoming a Lifelong Learner

Now I did not need teachers anymore.  
I found **facilitators** who guided me instead of controlling me.

I continued my learning journey.

Now I am a **STEAM Innovator** and an edupreneur (system creator).

I learned that **life itself is the biggest education, and no system can give that to you, though some systems can support it.**

I have learned from nature, people, and practice.  
This multidimensional learning helped me grow emotionally and manage relationships, something academia often overlooks.

I am like my mother, **connected to the earth**, so I also moved towards farm life.

## 🌟 Future Vision

I dream of a world where learning doesn’t mean sitting in a box for hours.  
Where kids can learn from trees and stars as much as from books.  
Where your grandmother's stories are as valuable as a textbook.

You know what I really want to see? Schools that feel like gardens — where every kid can grow in their own way and at their own pace.  
Where we don’t just learn about life, but actually live and experience it.

Maybe someday, we'll have places where:

1. Kids learn their grandma's recipes alongside chemistry  
2. Playing in mud is considered as important as learning math  
3. Every child's unique way of seeing the world is celebrated  
4. Nature is the first teacher  
5. Learning feels as natural as breathing

> **Everything else is helpful only when consciously chosen.**

Thank you for reading 🙏  
I hope someone, somewhere connects with this story.

> “The true purpose of education is to awaken the natural curiosity and creativity that lies within each of us.”

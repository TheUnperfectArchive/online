# 🪶 Education ≠ School

Hello!

I am here speaking from my "I", believing that each person's experiences are unique and special to the one who is living them firsthand.

So, I'm not beginning with school, because I remember my education began from my very home. And truthfully, it’s never going to end at school either.

School came in the middle of my journey, both as a hurdle and as a dark past that changed everything.

Let’s talk about that garbage later. First, let me share my educational qualifications, not the official ones, but the real ones.

## 🌿 My Roots

My mother came from a tribal background near Mumbai, from a place called Vasind, where she lived her entire life until she got married and moved to urban Mumbai.

She was just like me. She never liked being in the concrete jungle. But what could she do? She tried hard to bring her green soul alive by planting plants around the house, but no one else had any respect for that.

She was living the typical middle-class housewife life, overwhelmed with duties toward her in-laws, and often deeply traumatized.

Let’s not dive too deep into that darkness.

Still, she gave me skills and knowledge of handwork.  
She taught me painting, clay work, and other crafts.

Because of her, in the early days of school, I was a great artist and writer.

She came from a Marathi background and had done some schooling in the same medium. But no one around her ever considered her an "educated woman", maybe because her surroundings were filled with uneducated people.

## 🌼 My Early Education

As I started going to school, I lost her, not physically, but emotionally, because society started prioritizing my schooling more than my time with her.

But society isn’t as smart as me.  
I used to skip school just to be with her.

She was always busy, cooking four times a day for 12 to 16 people in our joint patriarchal Indian family.

Being with her, I became good at cooking too.  
But my elder brother was the most helpful child to her, more than me, and I’m proud of that.

Those early life experiences became far more valuable to me than anything I learned in any school, college, or university.

## 🏫 When School Became a Cage

School was never a place I wanted to be. I have my reasons.

It suppressed my natural talents, made me anxious, developed inferiority complexes, and left me disoriented.

In my first school, a Christian school, I had good memories. But in 5th grade, I was suddenly shifted to another school. With it came a cultural shock.

This new schooling failed me deeply.

It worsened my English by forcing multiple new languages at once.  
It treated art as a useless subject, which emotionally damaged me.  
And making friends became difficult in a space full of bullies.

To top it all off, my distinct appearance — fair skin and brown hair — made me harder to hide.

I started avoiding school.  
My parents weren’t in favor of it, but I found my ways.

I slowed down my school attendance.  
I learned how to do the bare minimum just to move to the next grade.

## 🌈 Escaping into Imagination

I began to live in fiction more than reality.

My brother and I watched a lot of cartoons.  
I used to draw cartoon characters and scenes from my imagination, until questions started to arise inside me.

I started getting interested in science, but not the kind in textbooks.

I was a slow tortoise 🐢  
It took me years to understand concepts that schools expected me to memorize overnight.

The school system wasn’t democratic. It was just a race.

I was sure that if I stayed trapped in that system, I’d be left with nothing real.

## 📚 Becoming a Self-Designed Learner

That’s how I became a **self-designed learner**.  
An autodidact, for life.

School was never a place of learning for me.  
It was a meaningless ritual, just a way to keep the spotlight off me.

I dropped out of school multiple times.  
I ran multiple social experiments.  
But doing it all alone, without support and with limited resources, many of my ideas failed.

While in academia, I pursued studies in chemistry and I liked the practical parts the most.  
At graduation and post-graduation levels, my science study went to a whole different level.  
But still, the curriculum was designed for careers, not for people.

## 🌱 A Turning Point

Eventually, I enrolled in the **Barefoot Social Research Fellowship**.  
There, I met my first *facilitator*, a word I had never heard before.  
Until then, I only had blind and deaf teachers.

This fellowship gave me wings.  
It introduced me to **interdisciplinary studies** and returned my freedom.

One day, after completing my research and mentoring juniors, I told my facilitator I wanted to leave formal academia and continue as a self-learner.

He told me about **Swaraj University**, a self-directed learning university in Udaipur, Rajasthan.

And from there, everything changed.

## 🦋 Living as a Lifelong Learner

I found freedom from teachers.  
I found support from facilitators.  
I continued my learning journey.

I now call myself a **STEAM facilitator and innovator**, not a teacher, instructor, or educator.

Academia had always limited travel with its busy and rigid system.  
But I later discovered that **travel is one of the greatest forms of self-education**.

Once I started, I never looked back.  
Even though my family still doesn’t fully understand my journey, and they try to pull me back sometimes, I now move at a speed that can’t be stopped.

I’ve studied natural sciences, applied sciences, and social sciences, just enough to serve my purpose.  
I’ve learned many other things that helped me grow emotionally and behaviorally, which helped me form my own kind of relationships.  
I also learned farming so that one day I could build my own green surroundings, because me and my mother are the same.

## 🌻 Closing Thoughts

So, that’s an overview of my learning journey.

**School is not equal to education**  
**Experiencing life deeply is the best kind of education**

Thank you for reading.

I hope someone, somewhere, resonates with what I’ve gone through.

We were born to be **warriors of change**  
So that no other story has to unfold in the same darkness.

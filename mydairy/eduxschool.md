# ü™∂ Education ‚â† School

## Hello!

I am here speaking from my 'I',  
believing that each other's experiences are unique and special to the one who is experiencing it first-hand.

So not beginning with school, because I remember my education began from my very home itself, and also it's never gonna end in school either.

School came in the middle of the journey as a hurdle, and also as a dark past that's gonna change everything.

Let's talk about garbage later. First, let me share about my educational qualifications.

My mother was coming from a tribal background near Mumbai, a place called Vasind, where she lived her entire life until she got married and shifted to an urban Mumbai basti.

She was like me, she never loved being in a concrete jungle, but what else could she do about it? She tried hard to bring her green soul by planting plants around the house, but no one else had any respect for that. She lived a typical middle-class housewife life, whose duty towards her in-laws was overwhelming, and most of the time she was traumatized.

Let's not dive into darkness further.

She gave me the skill and knowledge of handwork.

She taught me painting, clay work, and other crafts.

Due to her, in the beginning time of my school life, I was a great artist and writer.

She was from a Marathi background and did some schooling in the same medium.

But no one ever considered her an educated woman. Maybe because her surroundings were full of uneducated people.

Later, as I grew up and started with school, I lost her, because society was prioritising me more for school than being with her.

But! Society isn't as smart as me. I used to skip my school days and kept on living with her.

She was busy with her endless kitchen work ‚Äì cooking each day four times a day for 12 to 16 people in my house. Yeah! It was a typical Indian joint patriarchal family.

Being with her, I became good with cooking as well. My elder brother was the most helpful child to her, even more than me, and I‚Äôm proud of it.

So here now, in my actual life, those experiences added the most value, more than any school, college, or university I went through in my life.

School was never a place I ever wanted to be, and I have reasons. Because it destroyed my natural talent, made me anxious, developed inferiority complexes, and made me disoriented.

In my first school, which was a Christian school, I had good memories. But later, in my 5th class, I shifted to another school. It was a very sudden shift in the culture I was going to encounter soon.

That later schooling failed me at my best. It made my English worse by trying to introduce many other languages.

It made art the least important subject, which caused next-level emotional damages.

Making friends there was also difficult because a whole group of bullies existed with me.

I chose to avoid going to school later.  
But parents were not in favour of that. Still, I made my ways.  
I started to slow down with attending school.  
Later, I learned to do the bare minimum so I could keep moving to the upper class.

I mostly started living and aspiring to a life that was fiction.

Me and my brother used to watch a lot of cartoons.

I used to draw cartoon characters and random imaginations until I started with questions.

To keep this writing short, I‚Äôm skipping details.

With questions, I started to feel interest in studying science ‚Äì but not the textbook kind.

I was a slow tortoise üê¢. It took me years to understand a few things from the textbooks themselves, which was prohibited in the school examination race.

So for passing, I somehow struggled with memorizing, with my poor memory and attention.  
That's because my schooling was **not** democratic.

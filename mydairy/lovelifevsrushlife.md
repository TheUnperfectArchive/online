# 🫂 Lovelife Vs. ⌛ Rushlife


## 🏃‍♂️ **The Rush Begins**

**Ran! Fast... More faster!**  
*You baster, fly!*  
No no no... **teleport!**  
No no no... *born successful, you bloody slow, lazy rat.*  

Got little dramatic, na?  

It is a short and bold reflection of society’s mindset.  
It is called **Rushlife.**

## ⚙️ **The Race of Everything**

Rushlife gives *competition perception* to literally everything.  
Even **breathing fresh air** and **drinking clean water**  
have become part of this race.  

What was so natural and so obvious back in time  
now has to be **earned** and **owned.**

---

## 🧱 **Owning and Exploiting**

This achievement through *self-exploitation*  
reflects further in the **exploitation of what has been earned,**  
because the idea of *owning*  
is itself an allowance toward **misuse.**  

Interestingly, **freedom becomes exploitative**  
when it isn’t limited  
or not in the hands of the wise and responsible.  

There is another side of the coin.  
Owning also gives one the **right to protect,**  
the **right to heal,**  
and the **right to re-nourish** in modern times,  
if you have to prevent it from other exploitative owners.  

But for how long?  
It is a **failed system,**  
because in the course of surviving generations,  
it **dies.**

## 🧬 **Modern Humans and the Lost Balance**

Looking into *anthropology,*  
it is easy to say that **modern humans**  
are more **exploitative** and **greedy**  
than primitive ones.  

In the direction of Rushlife,  
**marriage** is another exploiting ritual.  
Maybe we talk about it later.

## 🌫️ **My Rushlife Story**

Since life is short and *intensively competitive*  
(at least that’s what school portrayed to me),  
I tried my best,  
but not great if compared with others.  

I was the **loser,**  
hence I got bored with this game already.  
**Winners** mostly stay stuck  
in the **addiction of rewards.**  

But yes,  
it’s not really dependent on *winner or loser class,*  
but on the **soul that knows.**

## 🔗 **Breaking the Chain**

> “Good that my chain of routine devotion broke,  
> now I’m free to connect truly, not mechanically.”  
> *— Idea derived from Saint Kabir*  

Beginning to slow down.  

Since everything about Rushlife  
was losing its **meaning and sense,**  
I’m still not sure of other ways.  

The **death of the old** will take its time,  
yet the **birth of the new** has no sign.  

I was in a long **emptiness**  
until I surrendered  
to whatever life is, *it is.*

---

## 🌊 **The Flow and the Dice**

Even in this state,  
I was operating from what I was familiar with.  
Even in the commitment of **trusting the flow,**  
I do rush with life.  

It is not easy,  
and not always a **win-win dice.** 🎲

## 💗 **Lovelife**

What’s missing  
is called **Lovelife.**

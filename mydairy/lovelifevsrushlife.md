# 🫂 **Lovelife** vs ⌛ **Rushlife**

---

## 🏃‍♂️ **The Rush Begins**

**Run! Fast... Faster!**  
*You baster, fly!*  
No no no... **teleport!**  
No no no... *you must be born successful already! You slow, lazy rat.*  

A bit dramatic, right?  

This is a simple but bold look at how society thinks.  
It is called **Rushlife.**

---

## ⚙️ **The Race of Everything**

Rushlife makes everything a **competition**.  
Even **breathing fresh air** and **drinking clean water**  
have become prizes in this endless race.  

What was once natural and simple  
now has to be **earned** and **owned.**

---

## 🧱 **Owning and Exploiting**

Working hard leads to achievement,  
but achievement can lead to further exploitation.  
The idea of *owning* something can allow **misuse.**  

Freedom can also be dangerous  
if it has no limits  
or is in the hands of the careless.  

Yet ownership has another side.  
It can give the **right to protect,**  
the **right to heal,**  
and the **right to take care of** what belongs to you.  

But for how long?  
This system is **failing.**  
Over generations, values **fade** and die.

## 🧬 **Modern Humans and the Lost Balance**

Looking at *anthropology,*  
modern humans seem more **greedy** and **selfish**  
than primitive humans.  

A paradox remains:  
are modern humans more barbaric than the barbarians?

## 🌫️ **My Rushlife Story**

Life is short  
and very competitive  
(at least that’s what school taught me).  

I tried my best,  
but compared to others, I was not enough.  

I became the **loser**,  
and the game bored me.  
**Winners** stay trapped  
in their **addiction to rewards.**  

But this is not about winning or losing.  
It is about the **soul that knows.**

---

## 🔗 **Breaking the Chain**

> “Good that my routine devotion broke,  
> now I’m free to connect truly, not mechanically.”  

I began to slow down.  

Rushlife had lost all **meaning**,  
yet I was still unsure of other paths.  

The **old ways** take time to fade.  
The **new ways** have not yet appeared.  

I was in a long **emptiness**,  
until I surrendered  
to life as it is — *it is.*

---

## 🌊 **The Flow and the Dice**

Even then,  
I acted from what I knew.  
Even while trying to **trust the flow**,  
I still rushed.  

Change is not easy.  
The dice do not always roll in our favor. 🎲

## 💗 **Lovelife**

What’s missing is called **Lovelife.**  

It cannot be fully defined.  
Definition limits it.  
It loses meaning when pinned down.  

I can only share how it feels,  
because I have felt it many times within me.  

It is like a harmonious rhythm,  
where everything moves with you.  

It is like a spontaneous dance,  
or a free movement that just **happens.**  

Why was dwelling in Lovelife important to me?  

Because it awakens **all the expressions** I carry.  
It flows through me when I walk with it.  

In Rushlife, rewards are obvious:  
good grades, a successful career, wealth, a perfect marriage.  

In Lovelife, there is **no race.**  
Only the endless practice of walking with yourself,  
with family, friends,  
with the needs of others,  
fully present in every step.  

Lovelife is the **divinity of life.**  

Because in the end,  
everything within us is a **belief**  
that drives behavior,  
creates action,  
sends ripples,  
that others experience  
and reflect back.

## 🌌 What Is a Career?

Let’s not rush to the dictionary to find what a “career” means.  
Because, really, what we believe it to be is far more important than what’s written there.

We all seem to be in a race, a race toward a “career” that promises success.  

But wait, what’s success?

Success, to me, is simply any goal we’ve defined and achieved.  
It gives us that mental high, a kind of emotional reward, something we all get addicted to.  
It may look meaningless to others, but to the one who achieves it, it feels profoundly significant.

I’m not saying that success is a delusion, nor am I denying its importance.  
I’m just asking, how often are we truly sure about what we want?

Most of us are caught in patterns, following trends, expectations, and social pressures,  
so unconsciously that we rarely experience the deep satisfaction we long for.

And then we declare,  
> “Humans can never be satisfied.”

But I disagree.  
In my philosophy, I believe that stable satisfaction, a peaceful, complete existence, is possible.  
It begins when we start asking,  
> “How much do we really know ourselves?”  
> “Who are you? And who am I?”

## 🌱 The Birth of My Curiosity

I’ll continue exploring those questions later.  

For now, I’ll share how it all began.  
I was a curious child, curious about many things.  

But it wasn’t me who chose curiosity.  
It came to me as a natural part of life.  
I followed it simply because no other option felt real.

By sixteen, I had already begun working professionally.  
My first title was **VFX artist**, born from my fascination with animation.  
I wanted to understand how those moving worlds were made.  

And what better way to learn than by doing?

I did well in that field, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t my final destination.  
I left the profession, but carried its lessons with me.  
I wove them into my ongoing journey through science, art, and imagination.

## 🎨 The Dream of a Polymath

I wanted to become a **polymath and designer**, like Leonardo da Vinci.  
Funny thing is, back then I didn’t even know who he was. 😄  
I was just a dreamer, not Google.

Day after day, I kept learning.  
Creating.  
Questioning.  
Building bridges between imagination and reality.

I became a resource for ideas, for creativity,  
but I refused to become just another human resource.  

Because I am human.  
And I cannot let myself be used for someone else’s purpose.  
I have dreams of my own.  

And that is why I never stayed in one place for long.

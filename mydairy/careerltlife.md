## Redefining Career, Success, and Satisfaction

Let’s not rush to the dictionary to define what a *career* is.  
Because really, what we believe it to be is far more important than what’s written there.

We all seem to be in a race, a race toward a “career” that promises success.

But wait… what *is* success?

To me, success is simply any goal we define and then achieve.  
It gives us that mental high, an emotional reward, something we all get addicted to.  
It might look meaningless to others, but for the one who achieves it, it feels deeply significant.

I’m not saying success is a delusion, and I’m not denying its importance.  
I’m just asking: *how often are we truly sure about what we want?*

Most of us are caught in patterns.  
We follow trends, expectations, and social pressures so unconsciously that we rarely experience the deep satisfaction we long for.

And then we declare:  
> “Humans can never be satisfied.”

But I disagree.  
In my philosophy, I believe stable satisfaction — a peaceful and complete existence — is possible.  
It begins when we start asking:

> “How much do we really know ourselves?”  
> “What is that 'I' we often refer to in our languages?”

I’ll explore those questions more, later.  
For now, let me share how it all began.

## A Curious Beginning

I was a curious child, curious about everything.  
But curiosity wasn’t a choice. It came naturally.  
I followed it because nothing else felt real.

By sixteen, I had already begun working professionally.  
My first title was **VFX Artist**, born from a fascination with animation.  
I wanted to know how those moving worlds were made.

And what better way to learn than by doing?

I did well in that field, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t my final destination.  
I left the profession, but carried its lessons with me.  
I wove them into my ongoing journey through science  
as a seeker of truth.

I was more like a **polymath or designer**, like Leonardo da Vinci.  
Funny thing is, back then I didn’t even know who he was. 😄  
I was just a dreamer, not Google.

## Learning, Questioning, Building

Day after day, I kept learning.  
Creating.  
Questioning.  
Building bridges between imagination and reality.

I became a resource for ideas and creativity.  
But I refused to become just another human resource.  
I am a human, with my own dreams and ambition.

That doesn’t mean I’m self-centred.  
Actually, I’m bored by self-centred goals.  
My ambitions work toward a larger picture, one that includes justice, happiness, and collective growth.

And the second thing I wanted, honestly, was to do nothing at all.

## Glitches in the System

But I found a glitch in every system I ever entered.  
Nothing is perfect, sure.  
But when systems are so rigid that they resist any meaningful change,  
I cannot truly contribute to them.

So why stay?

That’s why I never stayed in one place for long.

I know I’ve been called “unprofessional.”  
And I agree.

But when did I ever say I wanted to be professional?

I’m more of a revolutionary. I don’t even need to define it.

Building a career out of life was never my goal.

My journey is about exploration.  
To learn and know more.  
To study people and their systems.

Yes, a career is essential to survive in society.  
But my way of being isn’t easy — not for me, and not for the people around me.

Still, what’s the point of surviving if we lose life in the process?

## From Livelihood to Alivelihood

I want us to shift from **livelihood**, which is about survival,  
to **alivelihood**, a more conscious and holistic way of living.

The world needs this shift now more than ever.  
Because only through conscious existence can we bring about collective behavioural change  
and create systems that are truly friendly to human life.

Align yourself with moments that reflect your truth, even if only a little.  
Don’t seek jobs or business ventures that manifest your shadow.

Let there be a crack within you,  
so that the light hidden inside you can finally be seen.

Let your reputation be demolished,  
if it was never truly yours in the first place.

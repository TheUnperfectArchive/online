## üåå What Is a Career?

### Career Is Not Just a Job

Let‚Äôs not rush to the dictionary to find what a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù means.  
Because, really, what we believe it to be is far more important than what‚Äôs written there.

We all seem to be in a race, a race toward a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù that promises success.

### But What Is Success?

Success, to me, is simply any goal we‚Äôve defined and achieved.  
It gives us that mental high, a kind of emotional reward, something we all get addicted to.  
It may look meaningless to others, but to the one who achieves it, it feels profoundly significant.

I‚Äôm not saying that success is a delusion, nor am I denying its importance.  
I‚Äôm just asking, how often are we truly sure about what we want?

### The Pattern of Unconscious Doing

Most of us are caught in patterns, following trends, expectations, and social pressures,  
so unconsciously that we rarely experience the deep satisfaction we long for.

And then we declare,  
> ‚ÄúHumans can never be satisfied.‚Äù

But I disagree.  
In my philosophy, I believe that stable satisfaction, a peaceful, complete existence, is possible.

### The Real Question Begins

It begins when we start asking,  
> ‚ÄúHow much do we really know ourselves?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúWho are you? And who am I?‚Äù

## üå± The Birth of My Curiosity

### Curiosity Came to Me

I‚Äôll continue exploring those questions later.  

For now, I‚Äôll share how it all began.  
I was a curious child, curious about many things.  

But it wasn‚Äôt me who chose curiosity.  
It came to me as a natural part of life.  
I followed it simply because no other option felt real.

### My First Profession

By sixteen, I had already begun working professionally.  
My first title was **VFX artist**, born from my fascination with animation.  
I wanted to understand how those moving worlds were made.  

And what better way to learn than by doing?

---

### Letting Go to Move Forward

I did well in that field, but deep down, I knew it wasn‚Äôt my final destination.  
I left the profession, but carried its lessons with me.  
I wove them into my ongoing journey through science, art, and imagination.

## üé® The Dream of a Polymath

### Dreaming Before Google

I wanted to become a **polymath and designer**, like Leonardo da Vinci.  
Funny thing is, back then I didn‚Äôt even know who he was. üòÑ  
I was just a dreamer, not Google.

### Learning as a Way of Life

Day after day, I kept learning.  
Creating.  
Questioning.  
Building bridges between imagination and reality.

I became a resource for ideas, for creativity,  
but I refused to become just another human resource.  

---

### Because I Am Human

Because I am human.  
And I cannot let myself be used for someone else‚Äôs purpose if it is not aligned with my own.  
Because I have dreams of my own.  

That is why I never stayed in one place for long.

### Unprofessional or Just Honest?

It is considered unprofessional behaviour, and I agree with that.  
I am not saying I am unprofessional, but I am human ‚Äî a complete human.  

Understand me, and my existence.

---

### Career Was Never the Goal

Building a career was never my goal.  
I step into things purely to learn,  
to seek something that aligns with my beliefs and helps the true me to grow.

There is no worth or meaning in continuing my existence  
if it does not align with my beliefs and values.

I can exist while doing nothing,  
but I cannot survive against my soul‚Äôs desire.

## üîÅ From Livelihood to Alivelihood

### Surviving vs. Living

Career has become essential for survival in society.  
But what is the use of surviving if it doesn‚Äôt offer life within it?

Try to shift from **livelihood** (a survival necessity)  
to **alivelihood** (a holistic approach to living).

---

### A Call for Conscious Existence

The world needs this the most,  
because only through conscious existence can we bring collective behavioural change.

Participate in movements that align with your truth.  
Do not seek jobs or businesses that manifest your shadow parts.

---

### Let the Light In

Let there be a crack within you,  
so that the hidden light becomes visible.

Let your reputation demolish if it must.  
It is a drug society uses to prevent you from questioning it, from finding yourself.

### A Satisfied "Loser"

These are the words from the mouth of a so-called loser...  
but a **satisfied** one.
